These carriers are designed specifically for newborns and babies who are still developing their muscles and spine. Infant carriers typically offer additional support for the baby’s head, neck, and hips, ensuring that they are safely cradled while providing optimal comfort.

With more parents seeking products that reduce strain on their backs and shoulders, ergonomic infant carriers have become a go-to solution. These carriers are often designed with soft, breathable fabrics and adjustable straps to cater to the varying sizes and preferences of parents. As awareness of baby ergonomics grows, the demand for infant carriers is expected to continue expanding, particularly with the increasing preference for natural babywearing practices and the growing focus on early childhood development.</p> <h2>Application II: Toddler Carriers</h2> <p>Toddler carriers are designed for older children who are able to support their own heads but still need assistance when it comes to extended periods of carrying.

This flexibility enhances the value proposition of multi-position carriers, contributing to their growing popularity in the market.</p> <p>The ability to change carrying positions is particularly important for parents who want to alternate between carrying their baby in a front carry for bonding and comfort, and a rear carry for convenience and ease of movement.
